# tmxparser

This is a library for parsing the maps generated by
[Tiled Map Editor](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/).

The TMX format is based upon XML and may contain compressed and encoded tile
data to save memory and reduce file sizes. This parser uses the
[TinyXML](http://www.grinninglizard.com/tinyxml/) library and its DOM interface
to parse TMX files.

An example file is provided to understand how to use the library.

This project is forked from https://code.google.com/p/tmx-parser/ because:

 * Organized cleanly for inclusion into Debian. This means depending on zlib
   and TinyXML externally, building a shared library, installing to the correct
   prefix, etc.
 * Drop support for Android and Windows. If you want a Windows build, use
   [mxe](https://github.com/mxe/mxe).
 * Resolving the open issues: https://code.google.com/p/tmx-parser/issues/list
 * More robust tests.

## Features

 * Conformity with the [TMX specification page](https://github.com/bjorn/tiled/wiki/TMX-Map-Format).
 * Decodes and decompresses tile data.
 * Can parse properties as both integers, real numbers and literals (strings).
 * Can parse the map file when stored in memory.
 * Does not rely on any graphics library.
 * Animated tile support.

## Dependencies

 * zlib
 * TinyXML
